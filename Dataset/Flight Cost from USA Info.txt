A flight from the United States to Nepal can cost anywhere from $732 to over $2,600, depending on the route, travel dates, and booking time. Generally, round-trip flights to Kathmandu, the most popular destination, can be found for around $1,300 on average, with some deals as low as $753. However, flights to other Nepalese cities like Pokhara or Biratnagar can be significantly more expensive.

Factors Affecting Flight Costs:  

• Destination: Flights to Kathmandu are generally the most affordable, while destinations like Pokhara and Biratnagar can be more expensive.

• Booking Time: Research indicates that the cheapest time to book flights is usually 45 to 60 days before your travel date.
• Airlines: Different airlines offer varying prices, so comparing options can help you find the best deal.
• Flight Type: Indirect flights, which involve a stopover, are typically cheaper than direct flights, although they may take longer.  
• Season: Travel during peak season (spring and fall) will generally result in higher prices than off-season travel.  
• Airline Taxes and Fees: These fees are factored into the overall cost of the flight.  

Tips for Finding Cheap Flights:

• Use flight comparison websites: Sites like Skyscanner, Kayak, Momondo, and Booking.com can help you compare prices from various airlines.
• Be flexible with your travel dates: If you are flexible with your travel dates, you can often find cheaper flights by adjusting your departure and arrival times. 
• Consider flying on weekdays: Flights on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays are often cheaper than flights on weekends.
